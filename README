DTMD is a removable media mount daemon for Linux and FreeBSD

It detects CD/DVD-ROMs and currently attached removable media,
monitors their changes and reports them to clients.
It also allows to mount/unmount detected removable media
and specify subset of allowed mount options instead of default ones from configuration file.
Starting with version 2.4.0 it allows to poweroff devices.

There is a console client and Qt5-based gui client.

Console client has following commands available:
	list_all
		This command prints information about all currently detected removable devices
	list path
		This command prints information about specific removable device if it's present
	mount device [ mount_options ]
		This command allows to mount specified removable device and to use specific mount options
		Mandatory options set in config file, or compiled-in defaults if mandatory options aren't set in config,
		are appended to the provided options, overwriting values of specified options if necessary
	unmount device
		This command allows to unmount mounted removable device
	ls_fs
		This command prints list of filesystem daemon allows to mount
	ls_fs_opts [ filesystem ]
		This command prints options which may be used in mount command for specific filesystem
	poweroff device
		This command powers off device. Currently only implemented and available on Linux.
	monitor
		This command puts client into monitor mode similar to udev monitor, but only printing information about
		removable devices and their state changes

TODO: it currently doesn't work properly for CD-ROMs on FreeBSD
due to no notification on CD insert/eject
